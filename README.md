# codeInfoGrabber
This app scrapes user info such as profile, contest history, submission history from the users codeforces account and provides a nice JSON object


This app asks for the user's username in the site whose information they want.
Information from two different competitive coding sites are available:
(1) codeforces
(2) codechef

The app has been deployed at heroku at the link: https://codeinfoparser.herokuapp.com/codeforces/?handle=nipandas122 .
You can use this link by changing the 'codeforces' to 'codechef' and by giving your own handle in place of 'nipandas122'(which is my handle by the way)
